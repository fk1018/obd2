# Agent Guidelines

This repository uses Ruby with Bundler. When modifying code:

- Install dependencies with `bundle install` if needed.
- Run the test suite via `bundle exec rspec` and ensure it passes before committing.
- Follow the existing coding style; `rubocop` is not configured, so rely on idiomatic Ruby.
- Keep this file up to date with any new conventions or commands useful for agents.
